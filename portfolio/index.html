                        As a sophomore at the College of Charleston, I have explored many degree options and decided on Computer Information
                        Sytems as a definite path. I am thinking about adding a minor in Data Science, but that is yet to be finalized. I started
                        working at Blackbaud at 18, days before I graduated high school. I have learned a lot from my time at Blackbaud
                        and even found my niche in Salesforce. My dream job would be as a Salesforce Admin/Development Consultant travelling
                        the world. I am currently enrolled in Salesforce Admin 201 certification class on top of my regular courseload.
                        I will be testing for my certification in November.
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        I also have experience with mobile app development and working with start ups. As a freshman at the College, I was
                        accepted into the ICAT cohort through the business school where my team came in first place and recieved over $4,000
                        of seed money for our start up. I was the lead technical developer for this project.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Outside of classes and work, I serve as Deputy Chair of the College of Charleston Honor Board and as the Publications
                        and IT Director for my sorority, Kappa Alpha Theta. Wether it's running, kayaking, swimming, or biking, I feel like
                        my truest self when I am outdoors.
